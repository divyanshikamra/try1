This is a blog page made by Divyanshi Kamra. I'm a coding enthusiast, I find logics and maths interesting hence I chose to code. I started doing this fter I entered college,  CS101 being mt first learning experience. It was first then when this became one of my interests. But, being from electrical dept I could continue doing this as a part of my curriculum anymore. So, I started exploring this field on my own and grabbing opportunities which could help me stay connected to this. Then, I decided to be a part of [WnCC,IITB](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb) (Web and Coding Club,IIT Bombay) and [DevCom,IITB](https://www.facebook.com/devcom.iitbombay/) (Developer's Community) and started exploring various fields of Computer Science. I started practicing DSA, learning webd via making assignments using [django](https://github.com/divyanshikamra/djangoo) and [android studio](https://github.com/divyanshikamra/HangOut). To explore ML, I took a [course from Microsoft](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT275x+1T2020a/course/) on it to learn and practice the basics and became a part of a project on ML. This is all about my journey of coding as of now. 

The 2020 pandemic has been harsh for all of us, but it proved to be very beneficial for me. since, it gave me time to persue my interest in coding and try new and interesting things :)

Whenever you dream of achieving anything, the first question that turns up is "Why should you be preferred over your competitors?"
The answer I always have towards this my perserverance and determination. This blog page is about some inspiring stories, fictions(so that you become more determined each day :) ) and ofcourse tech articles (coz it's a page by a tech SAVY xD).
