With strong roots in statistics, Machine Learning is becoming one of the most interesting and fast-paced computer science fields to work in. There’s an endless supply of industries and applications machine learning can be applied to to make them more efficient and intelligent.

Chat bots, spam filtering, ad serving, search engines, and fraud detection, are among just a few examples of how machine learning models underpin everyday life. Machine learning is what lets us find patterns and create mathematical models for things that would sometimes be impossible for humans to do.

Unlike data science courses, which contain topics like exploratory data analysis, statistics, communication, and visualization techniques, machine learning courses focus on teaching only the machine learning algorithms, how they work mathematically, and how to utilize them in a programming language.

Now, it’s time to get started. Here’s a TL;DR of the top five machine learning courses this year.
